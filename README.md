# Depth-Map-Stereo-Camera
This repository implements a stereo image processing pipeline that detects and matches features between a stereo pair, computes a disparity map, and recovers camera pose for depth mapping. It provides a foundation for future 3D scene reconstruction using stereo vision techniques.
